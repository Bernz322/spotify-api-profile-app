## üë®‚Äçüè´ Request for Demo

Due to the changes mentioned in the "Note section" below, accessing the web application requires an individual to be added in my own Spotify Dashboard. If by chance you are interested, just request a demo from me (Email and Spotify name are required).

## üìÑ Note

All newly created app using this API are subject to the changes announced by Spotify for Developers on May 27th, 2021. A couple of features will now require the Spotify Name and Email of the user and add them on your Spotify Dashboard.
